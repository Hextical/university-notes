\section{Model Selection Basic Strategies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Criteria: $ R^2_{\text{adj}} $, AIC, BIC,
          MSPE, etc.\ explicitly penalizes unnecessarily
          complex models.
    \item Search strategies (use with chosen
          criterion)
\end{itemize}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Brute force: fit all possible regressions.
          With $ p $ predictors, we have
          $ \sum_{j=0}^{p} \binom{p}{j}=2^p $ possible models to fit.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Finds optimal model that may be computationally
                    intensive (or infeasible) if $ p $ is large.
          \end{itemize}

          \underline{Idea}: Find a ``good'' (useful)
          model in reasonable computational time (not necessarily optimal).
          Many strategies focus on adding/removing variables one at a time.
    \item Forward selection: add one variable at a time to model.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Start with a model that only has an intercept $ (\beta_0) $.
              \item Fit $ p $ simple linear regression models
                    \[ \symbf{y}=\beta_0 \symbf{1}+\beta_1\symbf{x}_j
                        +\symbf{\varepsilon}\quad j=1,\ldots,p \]
              \item Pick the best of $ p $ models (with 1 predictor)
                    according to chosen criterion, and add that variable
                    $ x_j $ to model.
              \item Fit $ (p-1) $ models containing $ x_j $
                    and one other variable.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item If none of $ (p-1) $ models improves
                              criterion, stop.
                        \item Pick the best of $ (p-1) $ models according
                              to criterion, so now we have $ 2 $ variables in the model.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
          Continue adding $ 1 $ variable at a time in this way until
          we can no more variables improve the criterion. The final
          model is one with the best criterion after we \emph{stop};
          that is, no further improvement is possible.

          \underline{Note}: Much faster than brute force as the
          maximum number of models to fit is:
          \[ p+(p-1)+\cdots+2+1=\sum_{i=1}^{p}i=\frac{p(p+1)}{2} \]
          which is $ \mathcal{O}(p^2) $ compared to $ \mathcal{O}(2^p) $
          for all possible regressions.
    \item Backward direction: remove one variable at a time to model.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Start with model that has $ p $ predictors.
              \item Fit $ p $ models that result from removing one variable
                    from the regression; that is, each one has $ (p-1) $
                    variables.
              \item Pick the best of $ p $ models according to criterion.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Eliminate that variable $ x_j $ from model.
                        \item Fit $ (p-1) $ models that remove $ x_j $
                              and one other variable from model.
                        \item Pick best of $ (p-1) $ models
                              (2 variables removed).
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
          Continue removing $ 1 $ variable at a time in this way until
          we can no more variables improve the criterion. Same computational
          complexity as forward selection.
    \item Forward-backwards (allows individual variables to be both added/removed)
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Start as in forward selection
              \item If we have $ k $ variables in model:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item Backwards: fit $ k $ models with $ (k-1) $
                              variables. If any of these improve criterion,
                              remove the variable.
                        \item Forwards: fit $ (p-k) $ models with $ (k+1) $
                              variables. If any of these improve criterion,
                              add that variable.
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\begin{itemize}
    \item These are the basic ``stepwise'' selection models to get
          a ``good'' (useful) model.
    \item Many other have sophisticated procedures available.
          For example, stochastic search, lasso.
    \item We've assumed that $ n>p $ because otherwise
          $ (X^\top X) $ is not invertible. More specialized
          methods needed if number of predictors is larger than sample size.
