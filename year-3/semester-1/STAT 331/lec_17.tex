\section{Effects of Individual Observations}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
    \item We say an observation $ (y_i,x_{i1},\ldots,x_{ip}) $
          is an outlier if it is substantially different from other
          observations. This can occur if its response
          and/or some of its explanatory variables have values that are unusual
          or extreme compared to the others. Outliers can occur
          for different reasons. For example, an extraordinary
          subject, data entry errors. Generally, we don't recommend removing
          outliers unless we have a strong reason to believe that observation
          is an error. But it can be useful to investigate what
          effect it has on our fitted model and quality of fit to
          the rest of data.
    \item How to detect and characterize outliers: Studentized residual
          \[ d_i=\frac{e_i}{\hat{\sigma}\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}}  \]
          are standardized to have approximately variance 1 where
          \[ e_i\sim\N{0,\sigma^2(1-h_{ii})} \]
          So, if $ \abs{d_i} $ is large, observation $ i $ could
          be considered an outlier in the sense of having an
          extreme value of response $ y_i $ (e.g. $ \abs{d_i}>3 $)
    \item Recall that $ h_{ii} $ is the $ i^{\text{th}} $ diagonal
          element of hat matrix $ H $. We call $ h_{ii} $ the \textbf{leverage}
          of observation $ i $.
          \[ \hat{\symbf{\mu}}=X\hat{\symbf{\beta}}=H\symbf{Y} \]
          so
          \[ \hat{\mu}_i=\begin{bmatrix}
                  h_{i1} & h_{i2} & \cdots & h_{i n}
              \end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}
                  y_1    \\
                  y_2    \\
                  \vdots \\
                  y_n
              \end{bmatrix}=\sum_{j=1}^{n} h_{i j}y_j
              =h_{ii}y_i+\sum_{j\neq i}h_{i j}y_j  \]
          so $ h_{ii} $ captures contribution of $ Y_i $ in determining
          its corresponding fitted value. If the leverage is large
          relative to $ h_{ij} $'s then $ \hat{\mu}_i $
          is mostly determined by $ Y_i $. In A3, you will show
          the leverage is between $ \frac{1}{n} $ and $ 1 $; that is,
          \[ \frac{1}{n} \le h_{ii}\le 1 \]
          If $ h_{ii}\approx 1 $, then $ \Var{e_i}=\sigma^2(1-h_{ii})\approx 0 $,
          which in turn implies $ y_i\approx \hat{\mu}_i $; that is,
          residuals with observations with high leverage tend to be small.

          Rule of thumb: an observation with leverage higher than twice the average
          leverage is considered high.
          \[ h_{ii}>2\bar{h} \]
          where $ \bar{h}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} h_{ii} $.
          \[ \tr{H}=\rank{X}=p+1 \]
          Recall that $ H=X(X^\top X)^{-1}X^\top $
          only involves predictors. Thus, leverage is useful
          to help identify outliers n the sense of having explanatory
          variables with extreme or unusual values. In simple
          linear regression,
          \[ h_{ii}=\frac{1}{n} +\frac{(x_i-\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}} \]
          Which means if $ x_i $ is far from $ \bar{x} $,
          that point will have high leverage. This generalizes
          to multiple linear regression: an observation
          with high leverage is an outlier with extreme values in one
          or more explanatory variables. However, leverage does not
          tell us directly whether that observation is also
          an outlier in response, in fact, $ y_i\approx \hat{\mu}_i $
          for such observations with high leverage.
    \item An observation $ i $ is quite influential if its presence
          in fitting regression considerably changes estimates compared to when
          observation $ i $ is not used to fit a model.

          Start with fitting $ \symbf{Y}=X\symbf{\beta}+\symbf{\varepsilon} $
          using all observations and call estimates $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}} $
          as usual in the least squares.

          Let $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)} $ denote the least squares estimates
          based on fitting a model with the $ i^{\text{th}} $
          observation removed.

          \underline{Idea}: If $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)} $
          is quite different from $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}} $, then
          observation $ i $ is highly influential. Measure this
          via \textbf{Cook's distance} between $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}} $
          and $ \hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)} $:
          \[ D_i=\frac{(\hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)}-\hat{\symbf{\beta}})^{\top}
                  X^\top X(\hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)}-\hat{\symbf{\beta}})}{
                  \hat{\sigma}^2(p+1)
              }  \]
          To see this intuition, let $ \hat{\symbf{\mu}}^{(i)}=X\hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)} $
          fitted values based on removing $ i^{\text{th}} $ observation and
          estimating $ \symbf{\beta} $. Then,
          \[ D_i=\frac{(X\hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)}-X\hat{\symbf{\beta}})^{\top}
                  (X\hat{\symbf{\beta}}^{(i)}-X\hat{\symbf{\beta}})}{
                  \hat{\sigma}^2(p+1)
              }=\frac{(\hat{\symbf{\mu}}^{(i)}-\hat{\symbf{\mu}})^\top
                  (\hat{\symbf{\mu}}^{(i)}-\hat{\symbf{\mu}})
              }{
                  \hat{\sigma}^2(p+1)
              }=\frac{
                  \norm{\hat{\symbf{\mu}}^{(i)}
                      -\hat{\symbf{\mu}}}^2
              }{
                  \hat{\sigma}^2(p+1)
              }    \]
          $ D_i $ measures the Euclidean distance between fitted
          values of two regressions that give
          $ \hat{\symbf{\mu}}^{(i)} $ and $ \hat{\symbf{\mu}} $,
          up to a scaling factor. Further, it can be shown
          \[ D_i=d_i^2\left( \frac{h_{ii}}{1-h_{ii}} \right)
              \left( \frac{1}{p+1} \right) \]
          where we can see that both $ d_i $ and $ h_{ii} $
          are key quantities to calculate $ D_i $ and
          observation $ i $ that are most influential will have
          larges of $ \abs{d_i} $ and $ h_{ii} $.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item High $ \abs{d_i}\rightarrow $ outlier in response
              \item High $ h_{ii}\rightarrow $ outlier in explanatory variable
          \end{itemize}
          So high influential observations tend to be outliers
          in the sense of having extreme values in \emph{both}
          response and one/more predictors. Check if some
          $ D_i $'s are much larger than others,
          as they would be the most influential observations.
\end{enumerate}
