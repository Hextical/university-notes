## Instagram Factorial Analysis

## Get the data
data <- read.csv(file = "instagram-factorial.csv", header = T)

Time <- data$Time
Frequency <- factor(data$Frequency, levels = c(0,1,2,3), 
                    labels = c("9:1", "7:1", "4:1", "1:1"))
Type <- factor(data$Type, levels = c(1,2), 
               labels = c("Photo", "Video"))

## Numerical summaries of the data
summary(data.frame(Time, Frequency, Type))
sd(Time)

## Condition Means
cond01 <- mean(Time[Frequency=="9:1" & Type == "Photo"])

## Marginal Means
print(paste("9:1 frequency -- ", round(mean(data[data$Frequency==0,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))
print(paste("7:1 frequency -- ", round(mean(data[data$Frequency==1,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))
print(paste("4:1 frequency -- ", round(mean(data[data$Frequency==2,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))
print(paste("1:1 frequency -- ", round(mean(data[data$Frequency==3,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))

print(paste("Photo -- ", round(mean(data[data$Type==1,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))
print(paste("Video -- ", round(mean(data[data$Type==2,]$Time), 2), sep = ""))

## Notes:
# Frequency seems to be have a large and significant main effect
# Type seems to have a small and maybe significant main effect
# Interaction between Frequency and Type is existent but minimal
# Thus, the main effects seem to drive variation in the response (engagement time)

## Formal Analysis of Variance
model <- lm(Time ~ Frequency * Type)
summary(model)

## Compare this "full" model to one with the interaction terms
model.red1 <- lm(Time ~ Frequency + Type)
anova(model.red1, model)

## Compare the main effects model with ones that exclude Frequency and Type
model.red2 <- lm(Time ~ Frequency)
anova(model.red2, model.red1)

model.red3 <- lm(Time ~ Type)
anova(model.red3, model.red1)

## Notes:
# Our intuition based on the plots was correct: the interaction is minimal but significant, and 
# both main effects are, with "Frequency" explaining most of the variation in engagement time.
