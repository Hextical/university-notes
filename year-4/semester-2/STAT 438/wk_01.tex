\section*{About this Course}
Three topics covered in this course:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Causal Inference.
    \item Missing Data.
    \item Measurement Error.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Basics in Biostatistics}
\textbf{Review}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimental Studies vs. Observational Studies.
    \item Statistics of Interest.
    \item Using Regression Models.
    \item Association vs. Causation.
\end{itemize}
\section*{Research Questions}
Questions to ask when studying a disease:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Which factors are associated with a given disease? These
          so-called \textcolor{Red}{risk factors} are sometimes referred to as predictors,
          explanatory variables, covariates, independent variables, or
          exposure variables, etc.
    \item Which factors are associated with the duration of a given
          disease?
    \item Correlation (Association) does not imply causation.
    \item Ultimately, we want to ask: which factors cause the disease, or
          which factors determine the duration of the disease?
\end{itemize}
\section*{Types of Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Experimental studies.
    \item Observational studies.
\end{itemize}
\section{Experimental Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In an experimental study, the investigator can manipulate the
          main (risk) factor of interest, while controlling for other
          factors.
    \item In a \underline{randomized experimental study}, such as a clinical trial,
          eligible people are randomly assigned to one of two or more
          groups. One group receives the treatment (such as a new
          drug) while the control group receives nothing or an inactive
          placebo.
    \item Due to randomization, the investigator can control for both
          known and unknown factors, while investigating, typically, a
          treatment comparison.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Randomization and Causal Inference}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Randomization is the perfect/golden design for causal
          inference.
    \item Random assignment of treatment (exposure) ensures balance
          across study arms with respect to observed and unobserved
          risk factors.
    \item Direct comparisons between treatment groups can be made.
    \item Any difference can be attributed to the causal effect of
          treatment.
    \item Randomization is not always feasible due to ethical/economic
          reasons.
    \item Even the treatment is randomized, the participant may not
          comply with the assigned treatment: compliance issue.
\end{itemize}
\section{Observational Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item These studies are typically based on sampling populations with
          subsequent measurement of various factors of interest. In this
          setting, we cannot even take advantage of a naturally
          occurring experiment that changed risk factor status conveniently.
    \item It is sometimes useful to use these studies to look at the
          natural history of a disease, but any attempt to identify
          causality between a risk factor and outcome must be done with
          great caution.
    \item There is no experimental setting, as study participants
          typically self-reflect their exposure categories. Nevertheless, in
          large part due to ethics, such studies are most often to what
          we have access in Biostatistics.
          \begin{Example}{Examples of Observational Studies}
              \begin{enumerate}
                  \item \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{Risk factor}: cigarette smoking.
                            \item \textbf{Outcome}: bladder cancer.
                        \end{itemize}
                  \item \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textbf{Risk factor}: distance of home from hazardous waste site.
                            \item \textbf{Outcome}: respiratory disease.
                        \end{itemize}
              \end{enumerate}
          \end{Example}
    \item Three most popular observational studies:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item \textcolor{Red}{Cross-sectional studies}.
              \item \textcolor{Red}{Cohort studies}.
              \item \textcolor{Red}{Case-control studies}.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item No control over which subjects have the exposure and which
          do not.
    \item Exposed and Unexposed groups may be quite different with
          respect to other subject characteristics.
    \item Differences in the outcome are not only due to the (risk)
          factor of interest, but also because of the masking effect of
          other covariates (confounders).
\end{itemize}

        \draw[->] (2) to (3);
    \end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Cross-sectional Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Individuals are selected from the target population and their
          status with respect to the risk factor and the disease status is
          ascertained at the same time.
    \item The data represents a snapshot view of the relation between
          the risk factor and the event occurrence.
    \item Surveys are often cross-section in nature where associations
          are of interest and less priority is given to establishing
          causation.
    \item Advantage: cross-sectional studies are typically short.
    \item Disadvantage: a serious problem with such cross-sectional
          studies is the inability to determine whether the disease
          outcome or the risk factor occurred first, again this makes
          causal inferences more problematic or almost impossible.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Cohort Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cohort studies typically include obtaining two groups from a
          pre-determined \# of individuals, one possessing and the other
          not possessing a risk factor of interest. Subsequent counts of
          cases (and non-cases) of a disease of interest are then
          recorded.
    \item Much more often than not, cohort studies are \textcolor{Red}{prospective}, but
          there are retrospective (or historical) cohort studies as well.
\end{itemize}

risk-factor status:

    \begin{NiceTabular}{|c|cc|c|}
        \toprule
        &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\emph{Disease}}\\
        \emph{Risk Factor} & Present ($ D $)                            & Absent ($ D^c $) & Total                                        \\
        \midrule
        Present ($ E $) & $ a $                            & $ b $                 & $ n_1 $         \\
        Absent ($ E^c $)  & $ c $                            & $ d $                 & $ n_2 $         \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{NiceTabular}
\end{table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $ a \sim \BIN[\big]{n_1,\Prob{D\given E}} $.
    \item $ c \sim \BIN[\big]{n_2,\Prob{D\given E^c}} $.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Case-control Studies}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In case-control studies, the direction of sampling differs from
          that of cohort studies. Specifically, the investigator selects a
          pre-determined \# of disease cases and non-cases (i.e.,
          controls), then looks retrospectively to see the \# of
          individuals with and without the risk factor in each group.
    \item Case-control studies are \textcolor{Red}{retrospective} studies.
\end{itemize}

        \midrule
        Total & $ n_1 $ & $ n_2 $\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{NiceTabular}

\begin{itemize}
    \item $ a \sim \BIN[\big]{n_1,\Prob{E\given D}} $.
    \item $ b \sim \BIN[\big]{n_2,\Prob{E\given D^c}} $.
