\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population}: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer (advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with no previous treatment).
    \item \textbf{Exposure}: Treatment with Immune therapy (with chemo vs chemo alone).
    \item \textbf{Outcome}: Overall survival.
    \item \textbf{Timeframe}: One year following diagnosis (study was conducted \printdayoff\daterange{2016-02-00}{2017-03-00}).%chktex 8

\subsection*{Example: Electronic cigarette use and smoking}
\begin{Example}{}
    \textbf{Research Question}: Is e-cigarette usage in youth associated with the initiation of
    cigarette smoking?
\end{Example}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider the following paper recently published by UW researchers.
    \item The full text of the paper is available through the course e-reserves.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Population}: Canadian secondary school students (age 15-19, grade 9-12 in Alberta and Ontario).
    \item \textbf{Exposure}: E-cigarette usage at baseline (2013/14 school year).
    \item \textbf{Outcome}: Cigarette smoking initiation 1-year later (by 2014/15 school year).
    \item \textbf{Timeframe}: One year of follow-up.

    \begin{NiceTabular}{cc|c|c|c}
        \Block{1-5}{Smoking Initiation Status}\\
        \Block{1-5}{\quad\qquad$D+$\quad\; $D-$} \\
        \cmidrule{3-4}
        \multirow{2}{*}{E-cig Usage} & $ E+ $ &  136 & 351 & 487$\to$\qty{27.9}{\percent}        \\
        \cmidrule{3-4}

        \cmidrule{3-4}
    \end{NiceTabular}
\end{table}
\[ \text{Relative Risk}=\frac{136/487}{1313/16831}=3.58 \]
Youth who used e-cigarettes had 3.58 times the rate of smoking initiation one year
later versus those who did not use e-cigarettes.
