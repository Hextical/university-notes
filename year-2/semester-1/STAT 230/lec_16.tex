\section{Lecture 16}
Consider a Poisson Process with rate $ \lambda $, (i.e. $ \lambda $ events
occur on average per unit time). Observe the process for $ t $ units of time.
Let $ X= $ \# of events that occur. Then, $ X \thicksim \poi(\mu) $, where
$ \mu=\lambda t $. That is,
\[ f(x)=\frac{e^{-\mu}\mu^x}{x!} \]

\subsection{Example}
Request coming in from a web server at a rate of $ 100 $ requests per minute.
$ \lambda = 100, t=\frac{1}{60} $
The \# of requests per second would be
\[ \poi\left(\mu=\frac{100}{60}=\frac{5}{3}\right) \]

\subsection{Combining Other Models with the Poisson Process (5.9)}
Problems may involve many different random variables!

\subsection{Example (Continued)}
We say that a second is quiet if it has no requests.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item Find probability that a second is quiet
    \item In a minute ($60$ non-overlapping seconds), find the probability of $10$ quiet seconds
    \item Find the probability of having to wait $ 30 $ non-overlapping seconds to get $ 2 $ quiet seconds
    \item Given (c), find the probability of $ 1 $ quiet second in the first $ 15 $ seconds
\end{enumerate}
(a) Let $ X= $ \# requests in a second. $ X \thicksim \poi(\nicefrac{5}{3}) $.

We want $ P(X=0)=\frac{e^{-\frac{5}{3}(\frac{5}{3})^0}}{0!}=0.189 $


(b) Let $ Y= $ \# quiet seconds out of 60. $ Y \thicksim \bin(60,0.189) $.

We want $ P(Y=10)=\binom{60}{10}(0.189)^{10}(0.811)^{50}=0.124 $

(c) Let $ Z= $ \# non-quiet seconds before getting $ 2 $ quiet seconds. 
$ Z \thicksim \nb(2,0.189) $.

We want $ P(Z=28)=\binom{29}{1}(0.189)^2(0.811)^{28}=0.003 $

(d) Let $ D= $ 1 quiet second in the first 15 seconds,
$ D_x=$ \# of quiet seconds out of 15. $ D_x \thicksim \bin(15,0.189) $.
\[ P(D_x=1)=\binom{15}{1}(0.189)^1(0.811)^{14} \]
We get,
\begin{align}
    P(D\mid\text{wait 30 to get 2 quiet})&=\frac{P(D\text{ AND wait 30 to get 2 quiet})}{P(\text{wait 30 to get 2 quiet})}\\
    &=\frac{P(D \text{ AND wait an additional 15 to get 1 additional quiet})}{P(C)} \\
    &=\frac{P(D)P(\text{wait an additional 15 to get 1 additional quiet}) }{P(C)}\\
    &=\frac{\binom{15}{1}(0.189)^1(0.811)^{14}\times (0.811)^{14}(0.189)}
    {\binom{29}{28}(0.189)^2(0.811)^{28}}\\
    &=\frac{\binom{15}{1}}{\binom{29}{28}}\\
    &=\frac{15}{29} 
\end{align}
In (3) we used the independence of non-overlapping time intervals and constant
probability of events.

Let $ X= $ \# of kids in a family.

    \subsubsection{Definition (Median)}
    The \emph{median} of a sample is a value such that half the results are 
    below it and half above it, when the results are arranged in numerical 
    order.
\end{defbox}

\begin{defbox}
    \subsubsection{Definition (Mode)}
    The \emph{mode} of the sample is the value which occurs most often. There
    is no guarantee there will be only a single mode.
\end{defbox}
Mean: average $ \rightarrow
\frac{1\times 3+2\times 10+3\times 1+4\times 1}{15} $

Median: $ 2 $

Mode: $ 2 $
