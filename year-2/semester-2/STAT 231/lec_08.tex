\section{Choosing a Statistical Model}

\underline{STAT 231}: Characteristics of the population
are unknown.

Data Summary:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extract important properties
    \item Fit the right model
\end{itemize}

\underline{Disappearance of the 400 hitter}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Batting average ?= proportion of successes
    \item Battling champion = person with the highest batting average
    \item Before $ 1950 $: 3 champions $ \geqslant 400 $
    \item Since $ 1953 $: 0
\end{itemize}
\underline{Question}: Why?

\underline{Arguments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Absolute
    \item Relative
    \item Better pitchers: Relief
    \item Better fielding: Glove sizes
    \item Better managing
\end{itemize}
All these arguments are incorrect.

The average points of the generic batter is roughly the same over time,
but the standard deviation decreases by a lot. Thus, we have a tighter Gaussian
distribution for the model today compared to back then since the average
player is pretty good (before there was huge variability).

\begin{defbox}
    \begin{definition}
        A \textbf{\emph{statistical model}} is a specification of the
        distribution from which the data set is drawn, where the attribute of interest
        is a parameter of that distribution.
    \end{definition}

\section{Maximum Likelihood Estimation}

\begin{exbox}
    \begin{example}
        A coin is tossed $ 200 $ times with $ y=110 $ heads. What can we say
        about the ``fairness'' of the coin?

        The attribute of interest is
        \[ P(\text{H})=\text{probability of heads}=\theta=\text{unknown} \]
        Based on our sample, we try to ``estimate'' $ \theta $.
        Let $ Y $ be the number of heads when we toss a coin $ 200 $ times,
        then our statistical model is: $ Y \thicksim \bin(200,\theta) $
        with $ y=110 $.
    \end{example}
\end{exbox}

\begin{exbox}
    \begin{example}
        How good are Canadians on Jeopardy? Let $ \{y_1,\ldots ,y_{10}\} $
        be our data set where $ y_i $ is the number of shows that the
        $ i^{\text{th}} $ Canadian appeared on.
        \[ \theta=P(\text{Canadian wins Jeopardy}) \]
        Is $ \hat{\theta}\gg\sfrac{1}{3} $?
        \[ \{y_1=2,y_2=3,y_3=1,y_4=5\} \]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $ y_1=\theta(1-\theta) $
            \item $ y_4=\theta^4(1-\theta) $
        \end{itemize}
        Then, our statistical model is $ Y_i \thicksim \geo(1-\theta) $
        for $ i=1,\ldots ,10 $.
    \end{example}
\end{exbox}
\underline{Objective}: The average salary of a UW co-op student is $ \$10000 $ per term.
Is this claim true? Suppose $ \{y_1,\ldots ,y_{100}\} $ is given and
\[ Y_i \thicksim N(\mu,\sigma^2) \]
where each $ i\in[1,100] $ are independent. We will answer this question later in the course.
